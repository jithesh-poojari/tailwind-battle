  <div class="size-40 rounded-full bg-green-400 border-8 border-black -ml-1.5 -mt-1.5 absolute -z-10"></div>
  <div>

    <div class="w-40 h-20 rounded-b-full border-8 border-blue-500 border-t-0"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex justify-center items-center h-screen`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to center its child elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport, ensuring the flower is positioned at the center of the screen.

- **Central Element (`div` with nested elements):** Within the flex container, two `<div>` elements are used to represent the central circular element and the petals of the flower. 

  - The first `<div>` with the class `size-40` represents the central circular element. It has a width and height of 40 units, and it is styled with the `rounded-full` utility to make it circular. Additionally, it has a background color of green (`bg-green-400`) and a border with a thickness of 8 units, colored black (`border-8 border-black`). Negative margin values (`-ml-1.5 -mt-1.5`) are applied to adjust its position slightly to align it perfectly with the petals.

  - The second `<div>` contains two nested `<div>` elements to represent the upper and lower petals of the flower. Each petal has a width of 40 units and a height of 20 units, with one rounded to resemble the upper part and the other rounded to resemble the lower part of a petal. They are styled with the `rounded-t-full` and `rounded-b-full` utilities, respectively. Additionally, they are given a border of 8 units thickness, colored blue (`border-8 border-blue-500`). One of the petals has a `border-b-0` utility to remove the bottom border, and the other has a `border-t-0` utility to remove the top border. To position the petals correctly, a margin of 152 units is applied to the left of the petals container (`ml-[152px]`).

Overall, this code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with a central circular element and two petals, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
