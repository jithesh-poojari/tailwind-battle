  <div class="w-2/12 h-32 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class="w-2/12 h-32 bg-red-500 self-end"></div>
  <div class="w-2/12 h-32 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class="w-2/12 h-32 bg-red-500 self-end"></div>
  <div class="w-2/12 h-32 bg-blue-500"></div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex h-screen px-[16px] py-[22px]`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to arrange its child elements horizontally. It also sets padding on the X-axis and Y-axis to create space around the petals. The height of the container is set to fill the entire screen (`h-screen`).

- **Petals (`div` with background colors):** Six `<div>` elements are used to represent the petals of the flower. Each `<div>` has a width of 2/12 of the container's width (`w-2/12`) and a height of 32 units (`h-32`). The background color of the petals alternates between red (`bg-red-500`) and blue (`bg-blue-500`). 

  - The first, third, and fifth petals have a class of `self-end`, which aligns them to the bottom of the container.

This implementation effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with alternating red and blue petals, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
