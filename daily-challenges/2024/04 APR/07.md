### Stats

**Accuracy**: 100%  
**Score**: 100%

### Code

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-pink-300">
  <div class="w-1 h-20 bg-white"></div>
  <div class="w-20 h-1 bg-white"></div>
  <div class="size-8 rounded-full bg-white"></div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-pink-300`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to center its child elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport. It sets the background color to a light pink shade (`bg-pink-300`), providing a soft backdrop for the flower.

- **Petals (`div` with background colors):** Three `<div>` elements are used to represent the petals of the flower. Each `<div>` has a width of 1 unit (`w-1`) and a height of 20 units (`h-20`) for the vertical petal, and a width of 20 units (`w-20`) and a height of 1 unit (`h-1`) for the horizontal petal. The background color of the petals is set to white (`bg-white`).

- **Central Element (`div` with background color):** One `<div>` element is used to represent the center of the flower. It has a width and height of 8 units (`size-8`) and is styled with Tailwind's `rounded-full` utility to make it circular. The background color of the central element is also set to white (`bg-white`). It is positioned in the center of the flex container using flex utilities.

This implementation effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with white petals on a pink background, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
