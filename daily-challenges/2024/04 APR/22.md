    <div class="absolute size-32 bg-slate-400 rounded-full border-[32px] border-slate-700"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`grid place-items-center h-screen bg-slate-50`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's grid utilities to center its child elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport (`place-items-center`). It sets the background color to a light slate shade (`bg-slate-50`), providing a suitable backdrop for the flower.

- **Central Element (`div` with nested elements):** Within the grid container, there is a `<div>` element representing the central circular element and the petals of the flower.

  - The central circular element (`div`) has a background color of slate (`bg-slate-400`), a size of 60 units (`size-60`), and is styled with rounded corners using the `rounded-[60px]` utility. It is positioned using flex utilities (`flex justify-center items-center`) to achieve the desired layout.
  
  - Next to the central circular element, there are five additional circular elements representing the petals and the stamen of the flower. Each petal consists of a nested `<div>` element with a background color of a darker slate shade (`bg-slate-700`), a height of 40 units (`h-40`), a width of 8 units (`w-8`), and rounded corners using the `rounded-lg` utility. Some of these elements are rotated using the `rotate-*` classes to achieve the desired orientation.
  
  - Inside the central circular element, there is another nested `<div>` element representing the stamen of the flower. It has a background color matching the central circular element (`bg-slate-400`), a size of 32 units (`size-32`), and is styled with a border using the `border-[32px] border-slate-700` utility.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with a central circular element, petals, and stamen, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
