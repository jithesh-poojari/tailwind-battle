<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-green-100">
  <div class="size-60 rounded-full bg-green-400 flex justify-center items-center relative">
    <div class="size-20 rounded-full bg-green-600 border-4 border-green-100"></div>
    <div class="size-8 rounded-full bg-green-600 border-4 border-green-100 absolute top-5 left-5"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-green-100`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to center its child elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport. It sets the background color to a light green shade (`bg-green-100`), providing a subtle backdrop for the flower.

- **Central Element (`div` with background color and positioning):** One `<div>` element is used to represent the center of the flower. It has a width and height of 60 units (`size-60`) and is styled with Tailwind's `rounded-full` utility to make it circular. The background color of the central element is set to a medium green shade (`bg-green-400`). It is positioned in the center of its parent container using flex utilities (`justify-center` and `items-center`).

- **Inner Elements (`div` with background color, size, and borders):** Two nested `<div>` elements are used to create the inner details of the central element. The first inner element has a width and height of 20 units (`size-20`) and is styled with a `rounded-full` utility to make it circular. It has a background color of a darker green shade (`bg-green-600`) and a border of 4 units with a light green shade (`border-green-100`). The second inner element has a width and height of 8 units (`size-8`) and is positioned absolutely (`absolute`) within the first inner element. It is styled similarly to the first inner element but smaller in size and positioned at the top left corner of the first inner element.

This implementation effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with a central element and inner details, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
