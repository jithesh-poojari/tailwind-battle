### Code

```html
<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-blue-50">
  <div class="w-20 h-10 rounded-full bg-blue-200 p-1">
    <div class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-blue-500"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-blue-50`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to center its child elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport. Additionally, it sets the background color to a light blue shade (`bg-blue-50`), providing a subtle backdrop for the flower.

- **Central Element (`div` with nested elements):** Within the flex container, a `<div>` element is used to represent the central circular element of the flower. It has a width of 20 units, a height of 10 units, and is styled with Tailwind's `rounded-full` utility to make it circular. The background color is set to a slightly darker blue shade (`bg-blue-200`). Inside this div, another nested `<div>` element is added to represent the center of the flower. This nested div has a width and height of 8 units, is also styled with `rounded-full` to make it circular, and has a background color of a darker blue shade (`bg-blue-500`). Additionally, padding of 1 unit (`p-1`) is applied to the outer div to create some space between the outer and inner circles.

This implementation effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with a central circular element, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
