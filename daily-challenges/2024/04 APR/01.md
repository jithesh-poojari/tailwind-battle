### Code

```html
<div class="flex flex-col gap-4 p-4">
  <div class="h-14 w-full bg-blue-500 rounded-xl"></div>
  <div class="h-14 w-full bg-orange-400 rounded-xl"></div>
  <div class="h-14 w-full bg-red-400 rounded-xl"></div>
</div>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Flex Container (`flex flex-col gap-4 p-4`):** This `<div>` container utilizes Tailwind's flex utilities to arrange its child elements in a column layout with a gap of 4 units between them. Additionally, padding of 4 units is applied to the container for spacing.

- **Petals (`div` with background colors):** Three `<div>` elements are utilized to represent the petals of the flower. Each `<div>` has a height of 14 units and spans the entire width of its container (`w-full`). Tailwind's background color utilities (`bg-blue-500`, `bg-orange-400`, and `bg-red-400`) are used to set the background color of each petal, giving them distinct colors.

  - The first `<div>` represents the uppermost petal with a blue background color.
  - The second `<div>` represents the middle petal with an orange background color.
  - The third `<div>` represents the lowermost petal with a red background color.

- **Petal Styling (`rounded-xl`):** Tailwind's border radius utility (`rounded-xl`) is applied to each petal to give them rounded corners, creating a more aesthetically pleasing appearance.

This implementation effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower with distinct colored petals, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
